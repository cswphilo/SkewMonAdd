# Formalization for Semi-Substructural Logics with Additives

We have formalized of semi-substructural logics with additive connectives.

The extension with addtive conjunction and disjunction is fully formalized, including 

- cut-free sequent calculus,
- focused sequent calculus, and
- correctness of the focused caclculus.

The formalization uses Agda 2.6.3.
