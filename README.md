# Formalization for Semi-Substructural Logics with Additives

The code includes the formalization of semi-substructural logics with additive connectives. 

The extension with conjunction is fully formalized, including a cut-free sequent calculus and a focused sequent calculus. 

The extension with both conjunction and disjunction is partially formalized with the cut-free sequent calculus being formalized, 
while the focused calculus is incomplete.

The formalization uses Agda 2.6.2.
